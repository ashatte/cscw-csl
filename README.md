.csl (Citation Style Language) file for the Computer Supported Cooperative Work Journal

http://www.springer.com/computer/journal/10606 

#### Citation style matches the following guidelines:

The CSCW Journal is both interdisciplinary and international. Bibliographical information therefore has to be unambiguous for a readership beyond the author’s local community.

The reference format is based on the Springer version of the APA format, but with additional requirements:
- To avoid mistakes, volume numbers, issue numbers, and page numbers must be indicated by standard labels (‘vol.’, ‘no.’, and ‘pp.’, respectively).
- Full article or book titles are required, also for proceedings.
- To avoid misidentification, authors’ names should include the first (or given) name.
